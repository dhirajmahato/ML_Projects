Here, I will add Machine Learning Models and usage and Explanations

## Types of ML
based on Human supervision:
1. Supervised
2. Semisupervised
3. Unsupervised
4. Reinforcement

based on data ingestion
1. batch processing
2. online processing

based on content
1. **Discriminative**: A Discriminative model ‌models the decision boundary between the classes (conditional probability distribution p(y|x)).
    - ‌Logistic regression, SVMs, ‌CNNs, RNNs, Nearest neighbours.
2. **Generative**: A Generative Model ‌explicitly models the actual distribution of each class (joint probability distribution p(x,y)).
    - Use Bayes rule to calculate P(Y |X)
    - Naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, Markov random fields, AutoEncoders, GANs.

based on parameter
1. parametric
2. Non-parametric

A **paramter** is something that is estimated from the training data and change (learnt) while training a model. They can be weights, coefficients, support vectors etc.
