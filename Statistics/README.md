## Statistics

   
### A. Introduction

#### 1. Population and Sample
- **Population**:  Population refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, or events that you want to study or make inferences about
- **Sample**: A sample is a subset of data from a larger data set called population.
- *Random Sampling* is a process in which each member in population has equal chance of being chosen for sample.

#### 2. Variable Data Types, Classification, Scales
- Data can be classified into 3 different types of data:
   1. **Cross-Sectional Data:** collected on several variables at the same point in time.   
   2. **Time Series Data:** collected on a single variable, such as demand for smartphones over several time intervals (weekly, monthly etc).
   3. **Panel or Longitudinal Data:** collected on several variables (multiple dimensions) over several time intervals. such as gross domestic product (GDP), Gini index, and unemployment rate collected forseveral countries over several years.
- observational data and experimental data (for establishing causal relationship). 
- Structured (Matrix) or Unstructured (audio, image ..)
- Structured data may contain variables that are either numeric or alpha numeric and may follow different scales of measurement
- Different measurement scales of variables like
   - **Nominal scale** (*Qualitative*)  That is, basic mathematical operations are meaningless  ---> Categorical variables marital status (single, married, divorced) and
industry type (manufacturing, healthcare, banking, insurance, and finance)
   - Any variable for which the ratios can be computed and are meaningful is called a **ratio scale** variable. Many continuous variables come under ratio scale; for example: demand for a product, market share of a brand, sales, salary, and so on.  
   - **Ordinal scale** is a variable type in which the value of the variable is captured from a rank ordered set. eg: g 5-point Likert scale in which 1 = Poor, 2 = Fair, 3 = Good, 4 = Very Good, and 5 = Excellent.
   - An **Interval scale** corresponds to a variable type in which the value of the variable is chosen from an interval set. In an interval scale, the ratios do not make sense.  The reference point is fixed arbitrarily. eg: Variables such as temperature measured in centigrade (oC) and intelligence quotient (IQ) score are examples of interval scales.


#### 3. Measures of Central Tendency
#### 4. Measures of Dispersion
#### Types
1. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset. 
2. Predictive
3. Prescriptive
4. Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Techniques like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are examples of inferential statistics.

### D. Statistics Distribution
Data distribution is the **frequency distribution** of individual values in a data set.

**Normal Distribution**

### E. Statistical Inference
